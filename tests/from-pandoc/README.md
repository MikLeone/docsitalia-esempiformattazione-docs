the `writer.*` and `tables.*` files here were taken from the pandoc
test files.

- in tables there seem to be different errors in every format
- in writer ODT loses code and quotes

comparing `writer.docx.odt.rst` with `writer.docx.rst`, there are many
differences. the DOCX document has kept more code blocks. there are
many artefacts, probably due to errors saving with libreoffice
